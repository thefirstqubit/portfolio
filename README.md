## Hello, I'm Martin 

I'm an aspiring cybersecurity professional in the midst of pivoting career paths after 11 years of accumulated experience in marketing and F&B throughout US and APAC markets.

Searching for internships and entry-level positions. I'm super interested in GRC, Security Auditing, and Vulnerability / Threat Management. Currently on track to obtain CompTia Security+ by Aug 2025.

Hobbies and Passions? Apartment DJ sets on Youtube, Stanley Kubrick movies, poker, learning and having deep conversations about tech, long distance running.
